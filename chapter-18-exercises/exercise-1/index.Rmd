##This is my report
I like writing **report**
```{r example, include = FALSE} 
numbers <- runif(1:100)
hist(numbers)
numbers_mean <- mean(numbers)
img_url <- "![puppies](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1108099/pexels-photo-1108099.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500)"
img_markdown <- paste0("![puppies](", img_url,")")
```
The mean of the numbers happens to be `r numbers_mean`.
`r image markdown`
```{r other_chunk}
print(numbers)
```
